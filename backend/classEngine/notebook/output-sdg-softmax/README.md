- source_sentence: In addition, by putting less weight on the upper part of the earnings
    distribution, the Gini index of the logarithm of earnings may yield a country
    ranking that differs from that of the Gini index. The logarithm of the 90/10 percentile
    ratio does not have these two weaknesses and is therefore preferred in this article.
    The main limitation of this measure is that it only builds on the estimated effect
    of explanatory variables at the 10th and 90th percentiles, and leaves aside effects
    on the middle class.

  - Its aim is to represent the interest of women entrepreneurs before national and
    international organisations and institutions, to reinforce the presence and representation
    of women within employer organisations and national chambers, and to promote women’s
    entrepreneurship and the advancement of women-owned enterprises by providing a
    supportive framework responsive to the specific needs for assistance, training
    and information for women entrepreneurs. It also showcases the accomplishments
    of women entrepreneurs and encourages women to consider entrepreneurship as a
    career option. An innovative way of promoting women-owned enterprises and their
    products is the CNFCE branding initiative to encourage women entrepreneurs to
    use the “Made in Tunisia by Women Entrepreneurs” label. Soon after the formation
    of the Council, the local chambers of commerce within the UAE, including Dubai
    and Abu Dhabi were encouraged to establish their own Businesswomen’s Committees.
  - Countries with a large share of their populations who are adolescents or young
    people have an opportunity to reap a substantial demographic bonus for their nations’
    economies, development, resilience and productivity. This requires investing in
    adolescents’ and young peoples human capital and expanding the range of choices
    and opportunities available to them. But many adolescents, especially girls, are
    denied the investments and opportunities that would enable them to realize their
    full potential. For example, 26 per cent of the world’s adolescent girls and 17
    per cent of boys between the ages of 11 and 15 are not in school.
- source_sentence: The reason for these difficulties is primarily the multitude of
    other factors that come into play over greater spatial scales and time horizons,
    a problem particularly acute for funds whose objectives are longer-term, transformational
    impacts. For example, some funds’ objectives are focussed on bringing down the
    costs of low-carbon technologies, demonstrating their technological or financial
    viability, or introducing them into new markets (e.g. CIF, 2012a). These programmes
    or funds focus on transforming the economics of low-carbon technologies at different
    scales, with a view towards transformational shifts in investment patterns from
    carbon-intensive production and consumption to low-carbon, climate-resilient investments.
  sentences:
  - Although the CAR is not designed for regularising land property rights, the authorities
    responsible for rural development and settlements can use the geo-referenced information
    about the location of rural plots (as declared by their owners or holders) to
    clarify land tenure. States are responsible for the implementation of the cadastre,
    but in many states less than 20% of the target rural area has been registered,
    especially in the North-east region (SFB, 2015a). The delay is caused in large
    part by a lack of staff and resources at the state and municipal levels. The federal
    government has invested in establishing the necessary information system and in
    building implementation capacity at state level. It developed a detailed plan
    for the implementation of the CAR, including appropriate budget, timeline and
    targets. More efforts are needed to raise awareness about the CAR - e.g. by launching
    information campaigns to encourage registration - and to develop capacities of
    states and municipalities to implement the system.
  - Short-term funding can create a gap between expectations and the ability to deliver
    and prevent longer-term processes of empowerment within communities (Box 4.1).
    The project provided USD18 million to over 400 local development councils created
    to manage their community’s development needs. However, tight deadlines to disburse
    project funds and bureaucratic rules meant that the councils were not able to
    develop into robust participatory structures, and were reduced to acting as transmission
    mechanisms for bank-controlled funds. Given the large variation in the characteristics
    between and within different fragile states, it is essential that donors and programme
    managers conduct a thorough and fine-grained analysis of the particular local
    or national context where they intend to implement a programme.

- source_sentence: 'ABSTRACT Deliberative democracy has been promoted as a way of
    improving legitimacy and political equality. This article seeks to understand
    how deliberation takes place within the intersection of two unique spaces: regional
    civil society groups in the Caribbean and communication in online forums. Specifically,
    I explore how various forms of participant diversity influence deliberation. Using
    both content analysis and interview data, I argue that occupational and country
    diversity contribute to the use of reasoned arguments. The results suggest that
    online deliberative spaces could be useful in international public policy arenas.'
  sentences:
  - The case has been made for using such schemes on a permanent basis to promote
    the right to work as a guaranteed entitlement, as in India's NREGS.71 In practice,
    few existing programmes are national in scope or provide a guaranteed entitlement,
    though some have become long-term interventions in response to high structural
    un- and underemployment or chronic food insecurity. This is the case for South
    Africa's Extended Public Works Programme (EPWP) and, prospectively, Ethiopia's
    Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) (see Box 3.4). Households whose members
    are unable to work (due to pregnancy, lactation, disability, illness or old age)
    receive the same transfer without work requirements.
  - Finnish companies are less likely to do so than those in countries more committed
    to radical innovation. Incentives for “radical” innovation development and adoption
    should be strengthened, not only through public funding programmes but also through
    stronger and more systemic (and inclusive) cross-sectoral collaboration and better
    aligned industry-science co-operation for research and innovation. In principle,
    aggregate figures place Finnish firms among the best performing of OECD countries
    in terms of co-operation (co-operating with others in innovation, all types of
    partners combined). A closer look shows that co-operation activity by SMEs seems
    to have suffered dramatically since the crisis and has not recovered to its 2008
    levels.

- source_sentence: While these levies do yield state revenue they have failed in the
    past to influence the behaviour of economic actors to a significant extent, due
    to low rates, too many exemptions and poor monitoring and enforcement (Mehling,
    2008). In the first instance, the lower end of each tax band was implemented,
    giving policymakers flexibility to increase the tax in response to changing circumstances.
    The National Assembly Standing Committee, the body responsible for setting tax
    rates and subsequently agreeing changes, can raise the tax without a repeated
    legislative process. However, computer-generated equilibrium (CGE) modelling in
    2014 of the impact of EPT compared to a business-as-usual scenario suggests that
    carbon dioxide emissions were curbed by about 2 million metric tons in 2012 and
    2013, or a decrease of about 1.7 per cent on business as usual (Huong, 2014).
  sentences:
  - It is a key source of food, energy, minerals, health, leisure and transport upon
    which hundreds of millions of people depend. However, the maritime industry landscape
    is poised to undergo a profound transition. Long considered the traditional domain
    of shipping, fishing and - since the 1960s - offshore oil and gas, new activities
    are emerging that are reshaping and diversifying maritime industries. While traditional
    maritime industries continue to innovate at a brisk rate, it is the emerging ocean
    industries that are attracting most of the attention. These industries include
    offshore wind, tidal and wave energy, oil and gas exploration and production in
    ultra-deep water and exceptionally harsh environments, offshore aquaculture, seabed
    mining, cruise tourism, maritime surveillance and marine biotechnology. The long-term
    potential for innovation, employment creation and economic growth offered by these
    sectors is impressive.
  - 'The reliance on existing data sources leads to three data measurement issues
    that need to be borne in mind when interpreting the findings of this paper. Data
    availability: This report draws from two types of data sources: i) country-level
    indicators published on a regular basis through administrative or statistical
    series by bodies such as, for example, Eurostat and the OECD, and ii) nationally
    representative micro-data from household- or school-based surveys, such as the
    European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) and the Health
    Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey. Where data is not already available,
    no efforts have been made to collect this data.'

- source_sentence: Informal entrepreneurship data is also collected in five year intervals
    for manufacturing and services (108 million employed in 2010, of which 35 million
    in manufacturing). Another source for employment data is the IHDS five yearly
    household survey, but the latest publicly available data is from 2005. The unorganised
